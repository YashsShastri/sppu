Certainly! Let's delve into the first assignment of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practicals for the Second Year (SE) Computer Engineering curriculum of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) under the 2019 pattern.

üßÆ Assignment 1: Complex Number Class
Objective:
Implement a class Complex to represent complex numbers and perform operations like addition, multiplication, and input/output using operator overloading.

Key Concepts:
1. Class:
A class is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) to operate on the data.

2. Constructor:
A constructor is a special member function that initializes objects of a class. It has the same name as the class and no return type.

Default Constructor: Initializes objects with default values.

Parameterized Constructor: Initializes objects with user-defined values.

3. Operator Overloading:
Operator overloading allows us to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types (classes). For example, we can define how the + operator works for complex numbers.

4. Friend Function:
A friend function is not a member of the class but has access to its private and protected members. It's useful for operator overloading when the left operand is not an object of the class.

Implementation:
Here's a C++ implementation of the Complex class:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
private:
    float real;
    float imag;

public:
    // Default Constructor
    Complex() : real(0), imag(0) {}

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Complex(float r, float i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overloading '+' operator
    Complex operator+(const Complex& c) {
        return Complex(real + c.real, imag + c.imag);
    }

    // Overloading '*' operator
    Complex operator*(const Complex& c) {
        return Complex(
            (real * c.real - imag * c.imag),
            (real * c.imag + imag * c.real)
        );
    }

    // Friend functions for input and output
    friend istream& operator>>(istream& in, Complex& c);
    friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, const Complex& c);
};

// Overloading '>>' operator
istream& operator>>(istream& in, Complex& c) {
    cout << "Enter real part: ";
    in >> c.real;
    cout << "Enter imaginary part: ";
    in >> c.imag;
    return in;
}

// Overloading '<<' operator
ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, const Complex& c) {
    out << c.real << " + " << c.imag << "i";
    return out;
}

int main() {
    Complex c1, c2, sum, product;

    cout << "Enter first complex number:\n";
    cin >> c1;

    cout << "Enter second complex number:\n";
    cin >> c2;

    sum = c1 + c2;
    product = c1 * c2;

    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Product: " << product << endl;

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Class Members:

real and imag store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Constructors:

The default constructor initializes both parts to 0.

The parameterized constructor allows initializing with specific values.

Operator Overloading:

The + operator adds corresponding real and imaginary parts.

The * operator multiplies two complex numbers using the formula:

(a + bi) * (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

Friend Functions:

operator>> allows inputting complex numbers using cin.

operator<< allows outputting complex numbers using cout.

Sample Output:
Enter first complex number:
Enter real part: 3
Enter imaginary part: 2
Enter second complex number:
Enter real part: 1
Enter imaginary part: 4
Sum: 4 + 6i
Product: -5 + 14i
Viva Questions:
What is a class in C++?

A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions to operate on that data.

What is the purpose of a constructor?

A constructor initializes objects of a class. It can set default or user-defined values.

Explain operator overloading.

Operator overloading allows redefining the behavior of operators for user-defined types.

Why use friend functions?

Friend functions can access private and protected members of a class, useful for operator overloading when the operator is not a member function.

How is complex number multiplication implemented?

Using the formula: (a + bi) * (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

This detailed explanation covers the first assignment. If you need similar breakdowns for the remaining assignments or further clarifications, feel free to ask!

üßë‚Äçüéì Assignment 2: Student Information System
Objective:
Develop a C++ program to create a database of student information including:

Name

Roll number

Class

Division

Date of Birth

Blood group

Contact address

Telephone number

Driving license number

Utilize concepts like constructors, destructors, static member functions, friend classes, this pointer, inline functions, dynamic memory allocation (new and delete), and exception handling.

Key Concepts:
1. Constructors and Destructors:
Constructor: A special member function that initializes objects of a class. It has the same name as the class and no return type.

Destructor: A special member function that is executed when an object is destroyed. It has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~) and no return type.

2. Static Member Functions:
Functions that are shared among all objects of a class. They can access only static data members.

3. Friend Classes:
A class that is declared as a friend inside another class can access its private and protected members.

4. this Pointer:
A pointer that points to the current object. It is used to refer to the invoking object.

5. Inline Functions:
Functions defined inside the class definition are treated as inline functions, which suggests to the compiler to insert the complete function code wherever the function is called.

6. Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Using new and delete operators to allocate and deallocate memory at runtime.

7. Exception Handling:
Mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, catch, and throw blocks.

Implementation:
Here's a C++ implementation of the Student Information System:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    string name;
    int roll_no;
    string class_name;
    char division;
    string dob;
    string blood_group;
    string address;
    long long telephone;
    string license_no;

    static int count;

public:
    // Constructor
    Student() {
        count++;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Student() {
        cout << "Destructor called for student: " << name << endl;
    }

    // Inline function to get data
    void getData() {
        cout << "Enter Name: ";
        getline(cin, name);
        cout << "Enter Roll Number: ";
        cin >> roll_no;
        cin.ignore();
        cout << "Enter Class: ";
        getline(cin, class_name);
        cout << "Enter Division: ";
        cin >> division;
        cin.ignore();
        cout << "Enter Date of Birth (DD/MM/YYYY): ";
        getline(cin, dob);
        cout << "Enter Blood Group: ";
        getline(cin, blood_group);
        cout << "Enter Address: ";
        getline(cin, address);
        cout << "Enter Telephone Number: ";
        cin >> telephone;
        cin.ignore();
        cout << "Enter Driving License Number: ";
        getline(cin, license_no);
    }

    // Inline function to display data
    void displayData() const {
        cout << "\nStudent Details:\n";
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Roll Number: " << roll_no << endl;
        cout << "Class: " << class_name << endl;
        cout << "Division: " << division << endl;
        cout << "Date of Birth: " << dob << endl;
        cout << "Blood Group: " << blood_group << endl;
        cout << "Address: " << address << endl;
        cout << "Telephone Number: " << telephone << endl;
        cout << "Driving License Number: " << license_no << endl;
    }

    // Static member function
    static void showCount() {
        cout << "Total number of students: " << count << endl;
    }

    // Friend class declaration
    friend class Admin;
};

int Student::count = 0;

// Friend class
class Admin {
public:
    void changeAddress(Student& s, const string& new_address) {
        s.address = new_address;
    }
};

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of students: ";
    cin >> n;
    cin.ignore();

    Student* students = new Student[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cout << "\nEnter details for student " << i + 1 << ":\n";
        students[i].getData();
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        students[i].displayData();
    }

    Student::showCount();

    // Using friend class to change address
    Admin admin;
    string new_address;
    cout << "\nEnter new address for student 1: ";
    getline(cin, new_address);
    admin.changeAddress(students[0], new_address);
    cout << "Updated details for student 1:\n";
    students[0].displayData();

    delete[] students;

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Class Members:

name, roll_no, class_name, division, dob, blood_group, address, telephone, and license_no store the student's information.

Static Member:

count keeps track of the number of Student objects created.

Constructor & Destructor:

The constructor increments the count each time a Student object is created.

The destructor outputs a message when a Student object is destroyed.

Inline Functions:

getData() and displayData() are defined inside the class, making them inline functions.

Friend Class:

Admin is a friend class of Student and can access its private members.

Dynamic Memory Allocation:

An array of Student objects is created using new and deallocated using delete[].

Sample Output:
Enter number of students: 1

Enter details for student 1:
Enter Name: John Doe
Enter Roll Number: 101
Enter Class: SE
Enter Division: A
Enter Date of Birth (DD/MM/YYYY): 01/01/2000
Enter Blood Group: O+
Enter Address: 123 Main Street
Enter Telephone Number: 9876543210
Enter Driving License Number: DL123456

Student Details:
Name: John Doe
Roll Number: 101
Class: SE
Division: A
Date of Birth: 01/01/2000
Blood Group: O+
Address: 123 Main Street
Telephone Number: 9876543210
Driving License Number: DL123456

Total number of students: 1

Enter new address for student 1: 456 Elm Street
Updated details for student 1:

Student Details:
Name: John Doe
Roll Number: 101
Class: SE
Division: A
Date of Birth: 01/01/2000
Blood Group: O+
Address: 456 Elm Street
Telephone Number: 9876543210
Driving License Number: DL123456
Destructor called for student: John Doe
Viva Questions:
What is the purpose of a constructor and destructor?

A constructor initializes objects when they are created, and a destructor cleans up resources when objects are destroyed.

Explain the use of static member functions.

Static member functions can be called without creating an object and can access only static data members.

How does a friend class work?

A friend class can access the private and protected members of another class in which it is declared as a friend.

What is the this pointer?

The this pointer points to the current object and is used to access members of the object from within its member functions.

Why use dynamic memory allocation?

Dynamic memory allocation allows allocating memory at runtime, which is useful when the size of data is not known at compile time.

How is exception handling implemented in C++?

Exception handling in C++ is implemented using try, catch, and throw blocks to handle runtime errors gracefully.

üßÆ Assignment 3: Matrix Class with Operator Overloading
Objective:
Develop a C++ program to implement a class Matrix that performs matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose using operator overloading.

Key Concepts:
1. Class:
A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions to operate on that data.

2. Operator Overloading:
Operator overloading allows redefining the behavior of operators for user-defined types. For matrices, operators like +, -, and * can be overloaded to perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively.

3. Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Using new and delete operators to allocate and deallocate memory at runtime, especially useful for creating matrices of variable sizes.

4. Friend Functions:
Friend functions can access private and protected members of a class, useful for operator overloading when the operator is not a member function.

Implementation:
Here's a C++ implementation of the Matrix class:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Matrix {
private:
    int rows;
    int cols;
    int** mat;

public:
    // Constructor
    Matrix(int r, int c) : rows(r), cols(c) {
        mat = new int*[rows];
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
            mat[i] = new int[cols];
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Matrix() {
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
            delete[] mat[i];
        delete[] mat;
    }

    // Input matrix elements
    void input() {
        cout << "Enter elements of " << rows << "x" << cols << " matrix:\n";
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
            for(int j = 0; j < cols; ++j)
                cin >> mat[i][j];
    }

    // Display matrix
    void display() const {
        cout << "Matrix:\n";
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < cols; ++j)
                cout << mat[i][j] << " ";
            cout << endl;
        }
    }

    // Operator overloading for addition
    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& m) {
        Matrix result(rows, cols);
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
            for(int j = 0; j < cols; ++j)
                result.mat[i][j] = mat[i][j] + m.mat[i][j];
        return result;
    }

    // Operator overloading for subtraction
    Matrix operator-(const Matrix& m) {
        Matrix result(rows, cols);
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
            for(int j = 0; j < cols; ++j)
                result.mat[i][j] = mat[i][j] - m.mat[i][j];
        return result;
    }

    // Operator overloading for multiplication
    Matrix operator*(const Matrix& m) {
        Matrix result(rows, m.cols);
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
            for(int j = 0; j < m.cols; ++j) {
                result.mat[i][j] = 0;
                for(int k = 0; k < cols; ++k)
                    result.mat[i][j] += mat[i][k] * m.mat[k][j];
            }
        return result;
    }

    // Transpose of matrix
    Matrix transpose() {
        Matrix result(cols, rows);
        for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
            for(int j = 0; j < cols; ++j)
                result.mat[j][i] = mat[i][j];
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    int r, c;
    cout << "Enter number of rows and columns for matrices: ";
    cin >> r >> c;

    Matrix m1(r, c), m2(r, c);
    cout << "Enter elements for first matrix:\n";
    m1.input();
    cout << "Enter elements for second matrix:\n";
    m2.input();

    Matrix sum = m1 + m2;
    cout << "Sum of matrices:\n";
    sum.display();

    Matrix diff = m1 - m2;
    cout << "Difference of matrices:\n";
    diff.display();

    if (r == c) {
        Matrix prod = m1 * m2;
        cout << "Product of matrices:\n";
        prod.display();
    } else {
        cout << "Matrix multiplication not possible due to dimension mismatch.\n";
    }

    Matrix trans = m1.transpose();
    cout << "Transpose of first matrix:\n";
    trans.display();

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Class Members:

rows and cols store the dimensions of the matrix.

mat is a double pointer used to dynamically allocate a 2D array.

Constructor & Destructor:

The constructor allocates memory for the matrix.

The destructor deallocates the memory to prevent memory leaks.

üìÅ Assignment 4: File Handling in C++
Objective:
Develop a C++ program that:

Creates an output file.

Writes information to it.

Closes the file.

Opens it again as an input file.

Reads the information from the file.

Key Concepts:
1. File Streams in C++:
C++ provides classes to perform file input and output:

ofstream: Stream class to write on files.

ifstream: Stream class to read from files.

fstream: Stream class to both read and write from/to files.

2. Opening and Closing Files:
Use the open() function to open a file.

Always close the file using the close() function to ensure data is properly saved and resources are freed.

3. Writing to a File:
Use the insertion operator (<<) with an ofstream or fstream object to write data to a file.

4. Reading from a File:
Use the extraction operator (>>) with an ifstream or fstream object to read data from a file.

5. File Modes:
ios::in: Open for reading.

ios::out: Open for writing.

ios::app: Append to the end of the file.

ios::binary: Open in binary mode.

Implementation:
Here's a C++ implementation demonstrating file handling:

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string filename = "student.txt";
    string name;
    int roll_no;
    float marks;

    // Writing to a file
    ofstream outfile;
    outfile.open(filename);
    if (!outfile) {
        cerr << "Error opening file for writing!" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    cout << "Enter student's name: ";
    getline(cin, name);
    cout << "Enter roll number: ";
    cin >> roll_no;
    cout << "Enter marks: ";
    cin >> marks;

    outfile << name << endl;
    outfile << roll_no << endl;
    outfile << marks << endl;

    outfile.close();
    cout << "Data written to file successfully." << endl;

    // Reading from a file
    ifstream infile;
    infile.open(filename);
    if (!infile) {
        cerr << "Error opening file for reading!" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    string read_name;
    int read_roll_no;
    float read_marks;

    getline(infile, read_name);
    infile >> read_roll_no;
    infile >> read_marks;

    infile.close();

    cout << "\nData read from file:" << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << read_name << endl;
    cout << "Roll Number: " << read_roll_no << endl;
    cout << "Marks: " << read_marks << endl;

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
File Creation and Writing:

An ofstream object outfile is created to write data to "student.txt".

The program prompts the user to enter a student's name, roll number, and marks.

These details are written to the file, each on a new line.

The file is then closed using outfile.close().

File Reading:

An ifstream object infile is created to read data from "student.txt".

The program reads the name using getline() to accommodate spaces.

Roll number and marks are read using the extraction operator (>>).

The file is closed using infile.close().

Sample Output:
Enter student's name: John Doe
Enter roll number: 101
Enter marks: 85.5
Data written to file successfully.

Data read from file:
Name: John Doe
Roll Number: 101
Marks: 85.5
Viva Questions:
What is the purpose of the fstream class in C++?

The fstream class is used for both reading from and writing to files.

Why is it important to close a file after operations?

Closing a file ensures that all data is properly saved and system resources are freed.

How do you read a line of text that includes spaces from a file?

Use the getline() function to read an entire line, including spaces.

What happens if you try to open a file that doesn't exist using ifstream?

The ifstream object will fail to open, and the fail() function will return true.

Explain the difference between text mode and binary mode in file handling.

Text mode treats the file as a sequence of characters, translating certain characters (like newline) as needed. Binary mode treats the file as a sequence of bytes, with no translation.

This detailed explanation covers the fourth assignment. If you need similar breakdowns for the remaining assignments or further clarifications, feel free to ask!

üìÅ Assignment 5: Function Templates and Exception Handling
Objective:
Write a C++ program using:

Function Templates to perform operations like swapping values or comparing.

Exception Handling for runtime error management like division by zero or invalid inputs.

Part A: Function Templates
What is a Template in C++?
Templates allow you to write generic functions or classes that work with any data type. Instead of writing multiple overloaded functions, you can write one template.

Syntax:
template <class T>
T functionName(T a, T b) {
    // function logic
}
class T or typename T is used to define a generic data type.

You can use T inside the function as a regular type.

Example: Swap Function using Template
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <class T>
void swapValues(T &a, T &b) {
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    float m = 1.1, n = 2.2;

    swapValues(x, y);
    cout << "Swapped int: x=" << x << " y=" << y << endl;

    swapValues(m, n);
    cout << "Swapped float: m=" << m << " n=" << n << endl;

    return 0;
}
Output:
Swapped int: x=20 y=10
Swapped float: m=2.2 n=1.1
Part B: Exception Handling in C++
What is Exception Handling?
It allows you to gracefully handle runtime errors without crashing the program.

Keywords:
try: Block to wrap code that might throw an exception.

catch: Block to handle the exception.

throw: Keyword to raise an exception.

Example: Division with Exception
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

float divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)
        throw "Division by zero error!";
    return float(a) / b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 0;
    try {
        float result = divide(x, y);
        cout << "Result = " << result << endl;
    }
    catch (const char* msg) {
        cerr << "Error: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
Output:
Error: Division by zero error!
Explanation:
Templates let you write type-independent logic (e.g., swap integers, floats, or characters with the same function).

Exception handling helps in catching and responding to errors like divide-by-zero, file-not-found, or invalid inputs during runtime.

Common Viva Questions:
What is a function template? Why is it useful?
It's a generic function that works with any type. It's useful to avoid rewriting similar functions for different data types.

Can you create templates for classes as well?
Yes, templates can be used for classes to make them generic.

What is the use of try-catch block?
It is used to detect and handle exceptions or runtime errors.

What happens if no catch block matches the thrown exception?
The program will terminate abnormally (default handler is invoked).

Can we catch all types of exceptions?
Yes, by using a catch block like catch (...), you can catch all exceptions.

Let's continue with the remaining assignments in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for SE Computer Engineering (SPPU 2019 Pattern):

üìÅ Assignment 6: Standard Template Library (STL) in C++
Objective:
Understand and implement basic STL containers like vector, list, map, set.

Use iterators to traverse these containers.

Demonstrate basic operations on these containers.

Key Concepts:
1. STL Containers:
STL provides several types of containers:

Sequence containers: vector, list, deque.

Associative containers: set, map, multiset, multimap.

Unordered containers: unordered_set, unordered_map.

2. Iterators:
An iterator is used to traverse containers, similar to pointers. They can be used with any STL container.

3. Common Operations on Containers:
Insert: Adding elements to the container.

Erase: Removing elements from the container.

Size: Get the number of elements.

Access elements: Direct or using iterators.

Implementation Example:
Part 1: Using a vector container
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> vec;

    // Adding elements to vector
    vec.push_back(10);
    vec.push_back(20);
    vec.push_back(30);

    // Traversing the vector using iterator
    cout << "Vector elements: ";
    for (auto it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Accessing and modifying an element
    vec[1] = 25;
    cout << "Updated vector elements: ";
    for (int i : vec) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
Output:
Vector elements: 10 20 30
Updated vector elements: 10 25 30
Part 2: Using a map container (Associative)
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    map<string, int> studentGrades;

    // Adding elements to map
    studentGrades["John"] = 85;
    studentGrades["Jane"] = 90;
    studentGrades["Mike"] = 78;

    // Traversing map using iterator
    cout << "Student Grades: \n";
    for (auto it = studentGrades.begin(); it != studentGrades.end(); ++it) {
        cout << it->first << ": " << it->second << endl;
    }

    // Accessing a specific element
    cout << "\nGrade of Jane: " << studentGrades["Jane"] << endl;

    return 0;
}
Output:
Student Grades:
Jane: 90
John: 85
Mike: 78

Grade of Jane: 90
Explanation:
Vector: It's a sequence container that stores elements in a dynamic array. Elements can be accessed by index, and it allows fast insertions and deletions at the end.

Map: It's an associative container that stores key-value pairs. It allows for fast look-up based on the key.

Common Viva Questions:
What is the difference between vector and list?

vector stores elements in contiguous memory, making random access fast. list is a doubly-linked list, and its elements are scattered in memory, making it slower for random access but faster for insertions and deletions in the middle.

What is an iterator in STL?

An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through the elements of a container, similar to a pointer.

What are the differences between map and unordered_map?

map stores elements in a sorted order based on the key, while unordered_map stores elements in an unsorted way, giving faster access on average.

What happens if you try to insert a duplicate key in a map?

In a map, duplicate keys are not allowed. If you insert a duplicate key, the value will simply be updated.

üìÅ Assignment 7: Inheritance in C++
Objective:
Implement inheritance and demonstrate the concepts of single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.

Key Concepts:
1. Single Inheritance:
A derived class inherits from a single base class.

class Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Base class" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Derived class" << endl;
    }
};
2. Multiple Inheritance:
A derived class inherits from more than one base class.

class Base1 {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Base1 class" << endl;
    }
};

class Base2 {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base2 class" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    void output() {
        cout << "Derived class" << endl;
    }
};
3. Multilevel Inheritance:
A derived class inherits from a base class, and another class inherits from that derived class.

class A {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Class A" << endl;
    }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Class B" << endl;
    }
};

class C : public B {
public:
    void output() {
        cout << "Class C" << endl;
    }
};
Example: Single Inheritance
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Base class" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Derived class" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.show();    // Inherited from Base
    obj.display(); // Defined in Derived
    return 0;
}
Output:
Base class
Derived class
Explanation:
Single Inheritance: The Derived class inherits the show() function from the Base class.

Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance are used for scenarios where classes share attributes and behavior across multiple levels.

Common Viva Questions:
What is inheritance in OOP?

It is a mechanism where a new class (derived class) inherits the properties and behaviors of an existing class (base class).

What is the difference between single and multiple inheritance?

Single inheritance involves a derived class inheriting from one base class, whereas multiple inheritance involves a derived class inheriting from more than one base class.

Can you inherit constructors in C++?

No, constructors are not inherited. However, you can call base class constructors in the derived class constructor using the initializer list.

What is the main benefit of inheritance?

It promotes reusability of code and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

üìÅ Assignment 8: Polymorphism in C++
Objective:
Demonstrate compile-time polymorphism (function overloading) and run-time polymorphism (function overriding).

Key Concepts:
1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Function Overloading):
Occurs when multiple functions with the same name exist but differ in parameters (number or type).

class Demo {
public:
    void display(int x) {
        cout << "Display with one argument: " << x << endl;
    }
    
    void display(int x, int y) {
        cout << "Display with two arguments: " << x << ", " << y << endl;
    }
};
2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Function Overriding):
Occurs when a derived class provides its specific implementation of a function that is already defined in the base class.

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base class show" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived class show" << endl;
    }
};
Example: Function Overloading and Overriding
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base class show" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived class show" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base *basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;
    
    basePtr = &derivedObj;
    basePtr->show();  // Run-time polymorphism

    return 0;
}
Output:
Derived class show
Explanation:
Compile-time polymorphism: Achieved through function overloading.

Run-time polymorphism: Achieved through function overriding using virtual keyword.

Common Viva Questions:
What is polymorphism?

It is the ability of a function, object, or method to take many forms.

What is the difference between function overloading and function overriding?

Overloading occurs at compile-time (same function name, different parameters), whereas overriding occurs at run-time (base class function redefined in derived class).

Why is the virtual keyword important in function overriding?

The virtual keyword ensures that the derived class's overridden function is called even when accessed through a base class pointer.

üìÅ Assignment 9: File Handling in C++
Objective:
Learn to perform basic file operations like reading from and writing to files.

Key Concepts:
1. File Stream Classes:
ifstream: Input file stream, used to read files.

ofstream: Output file stream, used to write to files.

fstream: Used for both reading and writing files.

2. File Operations:
open(): Opens a file.

close(): Closes the file.

read() and write(): Read or write to files.

getline(): Used to read a line from a file.

Implementation Example:
Part 1: Writing to a File
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream outFile;
    outFile.open("example.txt"); // Open the file

    if (outFile.is_open()) {
        outFile << "Hello, File Handling in C++!" << endl;
        outFile << "This is a new line." << endl;
        outFile.close(); // Close the file after writing
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open the file!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Part 2: Reading from a File
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream inFile;
    inFile.open("example.txt"); // Open the file

    string line;
    if (inFile.is_open()) {
        while (getline(inFile, line)) {
            cout << line << endl; // Print each line
        }
        inFile.close(); // Close the file after reading
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open the file!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
ofstream is used for writing to a file, while ifstream is used for reading.

The open() method is used to open the file, and close() is used to close it after operations.

Common Viva Questions:
What is the difference between ofstream and ifstream?

ofstream is used for writing to a file, while ifstream is used for reading from a file.

What is the purpose of the open() method in file handling?

It is used to associate a file stream with an actual file on disk.

What happens if you try to read from a file that is not open?

The program will fail to read from the file and may throw an error, depending on the error handling in place.

üìÅ Assignment 10: Exception Handling in C++
Objective:
Learn how to handle runtime errors in C++ using exception handling.

Key Concepts:
1. Try, Catch, Throw:
try: Block of code where exceptions are thrown.

catch: Block of code that handles exceptions.

throw: Used to throw an exception.

2. Standard Exceptions:
std::exception: Base class for all exceptions.

std::out_of_range, std::invalid_argument, std::runtime_error: Common standard exceptions.

Implementation Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
using namespace std;

int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)
        throw runtime_error("Division by zero error");
    return a / b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 0;
    try {
        cout << "Result: " << divide(x, y) << endl;
    } catch (const runtime_error &e) {
        cout << "Error: " << e.what() << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
try-catch block: The code inside the try block is executed, and if an exception is thrown, it is caught by the corresponding catch block.

throw is used to manually raise an exception.

Common Viva Questions:
What is the purpose of exception handling?

It is used to manage runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program, ensuring the program can recover from errors.

What happens if an exception is not caught?

If an exception is not caught, it leads to program termination, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

What is the difference between throw and catch?

throw is used to raise an exception, while catch is used to handle the exception.

üìÅ Assignment 11: Constructors and Destructors in C++
Objective:
Understand and implement constructors and destructors in C++.

Key Concepts:
1. Constructor:
A constructor is a special member function that is called when an object is created. It initializes the object's properties.

Default constructor: A constructor that takes no parameters.

Parameterized constructor: A constructor that takes parameters to initialize the object with specific values.

2. Destructor:
A destructor is a member function that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is deleted.

Implementation Example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    // Constructor
    Student(string n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
        cout << "Constructor called: " << name << " " << age << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Student() {
        cout << "Destructor called: " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1("John", 20); // Constructor is called
    return 0; // Destructor is called automatically
}
Output:
Constructor called: John 20
Destructor called: John
Explanation:
The constructor initializes the object when it is created.

The destructor is invoked automatically when the object is destroyed (out of scope).

Common Viva Questions:
What is the difference between a constructor and a destructor?

A constructor initializes an object when it is created, whereas a destructor is used to clean up resources when an object is destroyed.

What happens if a class does not have a constructor?

The compiler provides a default constructor that initializes the object.

Computer Graphics (CG) Practical:
üìÅ CG Assignment 1: Introduction to Graphics and Drawing 2D Shapes
Objective:
Learn to draw basic 2D shapes like lines, circles, and rectangles using graphics libraries.

Key Concepts:
Graphics Functions:

initgraph(): Initializes the graphics mode.

line(): Draws a line between two points.

circle(): Draws a circle with a specified center and radius.

rectangle(): Draws a rectangle with specified coordinates.

Implementation Example:
#include <graphics.h>
#include <conio.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int gd = DETECT, gm;
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "");

    // Draw a line
    line(100, 100, 200, 200);

    // Draw a circle
    circle(300, 200, 50);

    // Draw a rectangle
    rectangle(100, 300, 200, 400);

    getch();  // Wait for key press
    closegraph();  // Close graphics window

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
initgraph() initializes the graphics mode.

line(), circle(), and rectangle() are used to draw respective shapes.

Common Viva Questions:
What is the purpose of initgraph()?

It initializes the graphics system and sets up the graphics window.

How do you clear the screen in graphics mode?

Use the cleardevice() function to clear the screen.

What is the difference between a filled circle and an outlined circle?

A filled circle is drawn using fillellipse() while a simple circle is drawn with circle().

üìÅ CG Assignment 2: Transformations (Translation, Rotation, Scaling)
Objective:
Understand and implement basic 2D transformations: translation, rotation, and scaling.

Key Concepts:
Translation: Moving a shape from one position to another.

Rotation: Rotating a shape around a specific point.

Scaling: Increasing or decreasing the size of a shape.

Implementation Example:
#include <graphics.h>
#include <conio.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int gd = DETECT, gm;
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "");

    // Draw a line
    line(100, 100, 200, 200);

    // Translation (move the line by (50, 50))
    line(150, 150, 250, 250);

    getch();  // Wait for key press
    closegraph();  // Close graphics window

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The line is drawn at one position, and then translated by 50 pixels in both x and y directions.

Common Viva Questions:

üìÅ CG Assignment 3: Reflection and Shearing Transformations
Objective:
Understand and implement reflection and shearing transformations in 2D graphics.

Key Concepts:
Reflection: Flipping an object over a specific axis. Reflection can be done over:

X-axis

Y-axis

Origin (i.e., rotating the object 180 degrees)

Shearing: A transformation that shifts parts of an object in one direction, creating a slant or skew effect. It can be applied to:

X-axis shearing

Y-axis shearing

Reflection Example:
Reflection over the X-axis: The coordinates of the point 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) after reflection over the X-axis become 
(
x
,
‚àí
y
)
(x,‚àíy).

Reflection over the Y-axis: The coordinates of the point 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) after reflection over the Y-axis become 
(
‚àí
x
,
y
)
(‚àíx,y).

Implementation Example (Reflection and Shearing):
#include <graphics.h>
#include <conio.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int gd = DETECT, gm;
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "");

    // Original Line
    line(100, 100, 200, 200);

    // Reflection over X-axis
    line(100, 100, 200, -200);

    // Reflection over Y-axis
    line(100, -100, -200, -200);

    getch();  // Wait for key press
    closegraph();  // Close graphics window

    return 0;
}

Common Viva Questions:
What is the difference between reflection and rotation?

Reflection flips the object over a specific axis, while rotation turns the object around a point.

What is shearing, and where is it used?

Shearing is a transformation that causes a skewing effect, often used in computer graphics to create visual effects like slanting or perspective.

üìÅ CG Assignment 4: Clipping and Windowing Techniques
Objective:
Learn how to clip graphical objects to fit within a specified viewing window. This includes implementing algorithms like the Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm and Midpoint Circle Algorithm for drawing and clipping.

Key Concepts:
Clipping: The process of restricting drawing to a specific region, called the "clipping window". It is useful for rendering only the visible parts of objects.

Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm:

It is an efficient algorithm to clip a line segment to a rectangular window.

Cohen-Sutherland Algorithm:
The window is divided into 9 regions (using 4 boundaries), and each point is classified by a 4-bit code indicating its position relative to the window.

Based on this classification, it determines if the line segment is fully inside, fully outside, or partially intersects the window.

Implementation Example:
#include <graphics.h>
#include <conio.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int gd = DETECT, gm;
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "");

    // Clipping example: Draw line (100, 100) to (200, 200)
    line(100, 100, 200, 200);

    // Implement clipping algorithms as needed based on requirements

    getch();  // Wait for key press
    closegraph();  // Close graphics window

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
In this example, you would typically implement the line clipping logic using the Cohen-Sutherland or Liang-Barsky algorithm for clipping lines against a rectangular window. However, for simplicity, this is a basic drawing example.

Common Viva Questions:
What is line clipping?

Line clipping is the process of rendering only the part of the line that lies within a specified rectangular window.

What is the purpose of the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm?

It is used to efficiently clip a line to a rectangular viewport.

Implementation Example (3D Transformations):
#include <graphics.h>
#include <conio.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int gd = DETECT, gm;
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "");

    // Example: Apply 3D translation, rotation, scaling to a cube or object in 3D space
    // Note: You'll need to project 3D points to 2D for visual display on the screen

    getch();  // Wait for key press
    closegraph();  // Close graphics window

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
3D transformations work similarly to 2D but involve an extra coordinate (Z-axis). You need to project the 3D coordinates onto the 2D screen to visualize them.

For rendering 3D objects, you typically perform these transformations and then use a projection method (like perspective projection) to display them on the 2D screen.

Common Viva Questions:
What is the role of the Z-axis in 3D transformations?

The Z-axis adds depth to the transformation, allowing objects to be moved or rotated in 3D space.

What is the difference between 2D and 3D transformations?

2D transformations occur in a plane (X, Y), while 3D transformations occur in space (X, Y, Z).

üìÅ CG Assignment 6: B√©zier Curves and Spline Curves
Objective:
Learn to generate curves using B√©zier and spline techniques.

Key Concepts:
B√©zier Curve: A B√©zier curve is a parametric curve used in graphics and animation. It is defined by control points. A quadratic B√©zier curve has three control points, and a cubic B√©zier curve has four.

For a quadratic B√©zier curve, the formula is:

Spline Curves: A spline curve is a smooth curve defined by a set of points. B-splines and C-splines are common methods for generating smooth curves.

Implementation Example (B√©zier Curve):
#include <graphics.h>
#include <conio.h>
using namespace std;

void drawBezier(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
    for (float t = 0; t <= 1.0; t += 0.01) {
        float x = (1 - t)*(1 - t) * x0 + 2 * (1 - t) * t * x1 + t * t * x2;
        float y = (1 - t)*(1 - t) * y0 + 2 * (1 - t) * t * y1 + t * t * y2;
        putpixel(x, y, WHITE);
    }
}

int main() {
    int gd = DETECT, gm;
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "");

    drawBezier(100, 200, 200, 100, 300, 200); // Drawing a quadratic B√©zier curve

    getch();
    closegraph();

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The drawBezier() function calculates the points of the B√©zier curve for a set of control points and plots them.

B√©zier curves are fundamental in computer graphics for smooth paths.

Common Viva Questions:
What are the differences between a B√©zier curve and a spline curve?

B√©zier curves are defined by a small set of control points and are typically simpler, while spline curves are often defined by multiple points and used for more complex, smooth curves.

What is the purpose of the parameter 
t
t in B√©zier curves?

t
t represents the progression along the curve, and it varies between 0 and 1 to compute the points along the curve.
